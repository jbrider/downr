<p>I spent a little more time working on BlobFu. Now, it supports stream and byte-array publication <em>and </em> generic support for uploading and downloading in-memory objects to and from Azure blob storage. Within minutes you could be uploading anything
  - files or serializable object instances - to your Azure blob storage account. Via
  <a href="https://nuget.org/packages/BlobFu">NuGet</a>, BlobFu is available for anyone&apos;s use.&#xA0;</p>
<p>To get it, just use Visual Studio or WebMatrix 2 (which also supports NuGet packages) and install the package into your project and start using the BlobFuService class to upload and download files to Azure blob storage.&#xA0;</p>

<p>Happy blob storage!</p>
