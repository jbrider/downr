I have been wondering what it is that&apos;s so special about
<a href="http://www.twitter.com">twitter</a>  for a few weeks now and have been completely unable to figure out why I&apos;d ever want to use the service. I signed up but hadn&apos;t used it until last night when it occurred to me. Twitter is a tool that lets me chat in an asynchronous fashion
with the rest of the blogosphere (or at least those who have chosen to
<a href="http://twitter.com/bradygaster">follow me</a> ).
