<p>My search is over. The best part was that I not only secured a position, but that I secured a position with a company for whom I&apos;ve had a great amount of respect for the past few years. My new employer,
  <a href="http://www.nouveon.com" title="NouvEON - My new employer">NouvEON</a>, offers consulting services in the Charlotte, NC area and in cities nearby throughout the southeast. I had the pleasure of working with some NouvEON consultants in a previous position and had nothing but fond memories of their work ethic,
  code quality, and commitment to delivering the best product possible. I am proud to have secured a position doing what I love doing - consulting with small companies - via NouvEON, and look forward to helping our clients achieve success. I couldn&apos;t
  be happier and more excited to be consulting again, and for an organization that I&apos;ve been truly admiring since my first experience with their staff.
  <br>
  <br> I really appreciate all the help my colleagues provided me and all the support I received from friends, family, and my professional network.Like any industry, information technology professionals should nurture and maintain their relationships - with
  past clients, employers, recruiters, and peers. I&apos;ve been reminded of the most valuable lesson one can learn about being a professional - your network will work as hard for you as you do for it. When I sounded the alarm of my need for work I had colleagues
  from every corner of my career pop up to help me. My relationship with the NouvEON consultants helped me out tremendously, and I wholeheartedly appreciate their referral to my new employer. I am very excited for my own fortune and for the blessing of
  being employed by such an exciting company.</p>
