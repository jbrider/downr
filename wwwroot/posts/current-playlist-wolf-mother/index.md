This afternoon, while at a music store in Asheville looking for another one of the
<a href="http://www.kamibashi.com/papers/stringdolls/sd1015/sd1015.html">cutest items I&apos;ve ever received</a>, I discovered a new band called
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BTJCRM/103-2492282-4872612?v=glance&amp;n=5174">Wolfmother</a> . The guy who worked at the store asked G and I if we were Led Zel fans. When we replied with the typical &quot;of course,&quot; he turned this on. We agreed the obvious influence. Very good rock-influenced low-end guitars with a lot of crunch that&apos;s
complimented quite well by a vocalist who sounds as though he were created by a combination of Ozzy and Robert Plant&apos;s DNA. That&apos;s not a bad thing, now, don&apos;t get me wrong. Truth is, my head&apos;s definitely turned toward these guys at the moment. Worth a
look, for sure.
