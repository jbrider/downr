<p>The stories you hear about working at Microsoft and how we send and receive lots of email is true. It is more true than you could imagine. I&#x2019;ve been an
  <strike>addicted</strike> avid user of Outlook since I&#x2019;ve had a job but there are some features I&#x2019;ve not explored with any depth. Even with software, I sometimes strive to live a more Buddhist lifestyle and deny myself the investigation for features that I
  fear I will not find. That whole <strong>expecting it to be there and being disappointed when it isn&#x2019;t</strong>  thing is too depressing for me to go through, so I choose to minimize my expectations and not go hunting for features my life would benefit
  from having. No, really. I&#x2019;m just lazy. No but seriously, <strong>I have this obsessive rule about not seeing a scrollbar in my Inbox. </strong> Each day when the little scrollbar icon appears, shortening the width of my Inbox by 20 (or so) pixels, I
  cringe. I hate having more-than-a-scroll emails in my Inbox. </p>
<p>The feature I&#x2019;ve wanted (ever since I got the feature of not having to refresh my inbox) is to tell my inbox to stop auto-refreshing. I&#x2019;d never gone hunting for it. Tonight, I did, and I found it in 5 minutes. I like this feature so much I&#x2019;m going to
  show it off. You&#x2019;ve probably seen this already, but get this &#x2013; <strong>you can leave Outlook open and prevent it from checking your mail. </strong> That way, you can clean out your Inbox while simultaneously preventing it from refilling itself as you
  try to clean it out. </p>
<p>Here&#x2019;s the trick. On your Outlook ribbon in any of the modes &#x2013; email, calendar, tasks, whatever &#x2013; click the <strong>Send/Receive</strong>  ribbon. Then, toggle the <strong>Work Offline</strong>  feature. I&#x2019;ve highlighted my favorite part of the feature
  &#x2013; the &#x201C;if you do not want to receive new mail&#x201D; message. </p>

</p>
<p>As soon as you do this, Outlook will stop checking your email for you. The status bar reflects my newfound joy, knowing I can keep my old friend open but quiet as I prune away towards inbox-zero Nirvana. In the status bar, I can see that I&#x2019;m working offline.
  That way, once I get jittery in 15 minutes after not having received any new email, I can just look down and see why no one&#x2019;s emailing me. I&#x2019;ve temporarily put the incoming world on hold. </p>

</p>
<p>Whenever I&#x2019;m ready to stop being anti-social, I can go back to the Send/Receive tab and see that I&#x2019;m hiding via the greyed-out Work Offline toggle button. </p>

<p>Once I click that, Outlook connects and starts updating my folders&#x2026;</p>

</p>
<p>After a few seconds everything is updated and I&#x2019;m back online, with new fresh email to read&#x2026;</p>

<p>You probably already knew about this feature, but I&#x2019;m so excited I had to share it. Thanks, Outlook team, for being awesome. </p>
