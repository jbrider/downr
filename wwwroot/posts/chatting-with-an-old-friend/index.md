I was chatting with an old friend online today and it made me think about how cool the guy is. I tend not to rant about how much I dig my colleagues and friends, but I have to now - I got it stuck in my head and now I just gotta get it off of my chest.
Scott Cate is the main reason for my career success while I was in residing in Phoenix, AZ. He taught me a great deal about my own talent as a programmer and reminded me - through his own enthusiasm and vision for how things could be improved upon - of
how much fun this industry can be. During my professional engagement with Scott, I witnessed him motivate hundreds of people - through his humor, his willingness to remind those around him of their merits, and most importantly - in reminding them how
rewarding the act of perpetuating a community can truly be. Scott was not only focused on improving the developer community in Phoenix, but as a lifelong resident of the city, he has contributed hundreds of hours to making people feel better about their
own talents. Likewise, Scott has this innate ability to make you remember that you figured out a better way, so that must mean that there&apos;s an even better way  right around the corner, and that you&apos;re only going to
find the really sugary moments after a lot of thought, practice, and patience. Those kinds of people - the ones who motivate you to be better out of the sheer possibillity that you could be better  - are the types
of people that make evolution happen. Heck, he&apos;s a great drinking partner too. Plus, the guy&apos;s got a stroke of unpredictability that an obsessive compulsive would envy; just to make sure I made it in time for a Radiohead concert my best friend had purchased
tickets to, Scott helped me drive home - from Phoenix to Atlanta.  That&apos;s no joke. Scott, I&apos;m glad you&apos;re my dawg.
