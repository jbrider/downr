i&apos;ve not had much to say about politics since the elections are over. truth is, i don&apos;t have too much to say about it. perhaps i know there&apos;s no point whatsoever in getting all pissy. i know there&apos;s absolutely no point to bitching about it. moreso, i
know that i&apos;ll accomplish nothing save absolute frustration if i begin to read all the articles that go into the discrepancies and what-not. the truth is, i feel completely and totally disenfranchised. not because of the vote count, not because i don&apos;t
believe it (i do believe all was legal, in fact, and i&apos;ll be shocked if i learn otherwise to be the case), and not because bush won. he DID win. who care how many million people &quot;can&apos;t be wrong&quot; or whatever. the rest of the world (like those of us who
voted for kerry) know that bush is bad for the country and the world. but that&apos;s beside the point. my point, my anger, and the only thing that i will say about this whole thing, is that the electoral college needs to go away, for good, and never, ever
return. if the us citizens don&apos;t stand up now and voice the discontent over this group, we&apos;re more moronic than anyone who&apos;d be stupid enough to opt for a white house address. i feel i have the right to say this because certain states had their red/blue
color painted throughout prior to 100% of the votes in the states being counted. that&apos;s crap, plain and simple. who has the right to say, at around 9 pm, that north carolina (for example, i&apos;m not trying to get flamed for whatever, i just live here, ok?)
has &quot;gone to bush&quot; when the people are still standing in line to vote a few miles away? that&apos;s crap. its also crap to me that any other state with people standing in line was called. it disenfranchises each and every person who was in line, who hadn&apos;t
yet voted. to boot, i think that it may have even screwed up the voting entirely - how would you feel if you were standing in line to vote and you heard that the state in which you lived - and were about to vote - had already been called? would you continue
to stand there? would you waste your time? would you feel swayed when you finally got up to the poll? well? that&apos;s my point - if we as a people, as a country, are the ones who get to decide who goes into the white house, how in the hell can the electoral
college vote unless every single vote had been counted? huh? tell me? for that matter, why don&apos;t the individual states have a college? how come the people in north carolina get the elect their own governor, but don&apos;t get the right to elect their own president?
it ticks me off that the same rules fail to apply between state and federal elections. that&apos;s it and that&apos;s all. its the end of my rant, the end of my complaints about the whole fiasco that was the 2004 election. i hope we can all band together now to
make a better country. i hope we can all get past the blue-state/red-state thing and just be one big redm white, and blue country, with a focus on making its relationship with all the other countries a little more productive and a lot more peaceful.
