<p>My team has been working diligently for the past few months preparing a series of samples that demonstrate various Azure techniques, technologies, and ideas. We just completed one of these samples &#x2013; the MyTODO web site project. MyTODO is a simple list-making
  application written using ASP.NET MVC 4, ASP.NET Web API, jQuery, and jQuery Mobile. The site is quite easy to use in both a desktop web browser and from any mobile device that supports HTML 5 and jQuery Mobile. This blog post will introduce you to
  the sample and contains a short video that walks you through the process of installing it in your very own Azure Web Site.&#xA0; </p>
<p>First and foremost, let me guide you to the sample on both the MSDN Samples Gallery site and to the GitHub.com repository where we&#x2019;ll be maintaining the MyTODO sample. The Azure Evangelism team uses GitHub.com repositories for each of the samples we&#x2019;ll
  produce. If you notice a bug or something you think would augment the sample, feel free to use the Issues tab in the repository to tell us what you think we should fix or change. If you add to the code in the demo or change something and want your change
  to find its way into the sample, feel free to submit a pull request, too, as we&#x2019;re always looking to enhance the quality of our samples with things added by the community. The
  <a href="https://github.com/WindowsAzure-Samples/MyTODO">MyTODO GitHub.com repository is located here</a>, and the
  <a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/windowsazure/MyTODO-on-Windows-Azure-731f88d0">MSDN Samples Gallery page is located here</a>, in case you don&#x2019;t use GitHub.com. </p>
<p>My teammates
  <a href="http://blog.ntotten.com/">Nathan Totten</a>  and
  <a href="http://blog.syntaxc4.net/">Cory Fowler</a>  are also hard at work coming up with some other samples that will help you learn more about Azure Web Sites, so keep watching their blogs to find out when they publish their samples. </p>
<p>Now, sit back, sip your coffee or your water, and enjoy a short video that walks you through the process of downloading the sample code and getting it deployed to Azure Web Sites. The
  <a href="https://github.com/WindowsAzure-Samples/MyTODO/blob/master/GettingStarted.md">Getting Started</a>  document walks you through this, but we thought a video would be a nice option if you&#x2019;re in a hurry to get going. Once you
  <a href="http://bit.ly/wawsfreeoffer">create your free Azure account</a>  (which will give you 12 months with 10 free web sites), you can download the code or clone the GitHub.com repository, create your own site, and publish the code to your site in under 15 minutes. </p>
