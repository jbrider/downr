A colleague sent me an article today about
<a href="http://www.codepost.org/view/126" title="CodePost | View - [C#] New language features in C# 3.0">some of the new language features in C# 3.0</a> . I couldn&apos;t resist but get a little unnerved by the discussions that have begun regarding the third release of C#, bearing in mind that the second release has still not yet received complete adoption. At
this point my company has made a few decisions regarding the adoption of 2.0. Mainly, we&apos;ve decided not to adopt it, or at least, not to adopt it yet, and to wait until such time as it is more popular with the IT staffers who control the computers on
which our software runs. We don&apos;t control the state government offices in which our software packages are installed, and we don&apos;t control a lot of other things that our clients have to maintain. Too many technologists are too hardcore these days about
harnessing the new stuff, and I think that Microsoft and other such companies do a horrible job of supporting the developers who use their stuff. I heard a client just this week complain about another software company (link not provided, but let&apos;s say
that they&apos;re pretty huge and in a lot of cases the MS of their own industry) who forces the upgrade process down their throats by not providing support for previous releases. I understand this notion from being in the industry as a developer, but at the
same time feel that a distinction can be drawn between companies who write software and companies who write software the sole purpose of which is to write other software. In situations such as this - Java, .Net, PowerBuilder, all of it - that support
for linguistic adoption and utilization should never be dropped. I urge Microsoft to concentrate not on the horizon, but on the current adoption. Likewise, I urge the developers who are working with the communities being driven by technology to do their
best to remember those of us who are not only using the existing &quot;stuff,&quot; but also who have clients who have no option but to continue to do so for the foreseeable future. &quot;Because it is cool, Because it is new, and Because the old stuff is so... old,&quot;
are all poor excuses for adopting new technology. If your clients and customers want the latest and greatest, go for it. If they aren&apos;t interested, don&apos;t force them. And for GOD&apos;S SAKE people, take a slow look at the technologies before you begin to talk
about them and to adopt them into environments that may suffer should the technologies fail or prove to be less than effective options to what you know works.
