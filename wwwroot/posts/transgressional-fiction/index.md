I got to speaking about interesting Fight Club assignments this morning with a peer over the Internet. Given that I think FC is about the best work of the past 10 years, the most groundbreaking idea to hit the minds of any penis-enabled individual this
generation, and pretty much seeing as how I consider the ties that bind us to be self-imposed, I found the definition of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgressional_fiction">Transgressional fiction</a>  to be of interest. Albeit ironic that there&apos;s a terminology for this literary style, one must appreciate the feasibility of the human psyche&apos;s inability to deal with things that can&apos;t (or refuse to be) labelled and thereby
deal with the fact that labels are requisite for communication, even when the mere act of labelling something refutes the very point of it in the first place. Camus said that to &quot;define yourself as an existentialist would refute the term itself,&quot; since
no man is anything but himself and should never allow labels to be accepted. Camus, being obviously an idiot, couldn&apos;t have imagined how fucking vapid and idealess we as a modern culture could have ever become. We need labels, because labels group us
into categories that make understanding where YOU are in your process via a simplistic comparison to EVERYONE ELSE. Therefore it seems obvious that self-definition is impossible, and that the only truths are those that arise from comparison. Pretty sad
if you let yourself think about it. So don&apos;t. Just do your own thing. But however you do it, read at least one of these books. Then, come back and we&apos;ll chat.
