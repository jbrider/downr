I&apos;m watching Saturday Night Live right now. Its the 14th time Steve Martin has hosted - a pretty nice record. He&apos;s great and all, but Prince is the musical artist. I&apos;ve always dug that guy, but tonight&apos;s first performance was a remnder not only of Prince&apos;s
flamboyance and innate stage presence, but of his amazing music ability. Especially, that is, if you&apos;re looking at him with a guitarist&apos;s perspective. I think I heard once that Prince had been voted best guitarist of some-odd year or something. If he
wasn&apos;t, the first performance - &quot;Like a Woman Scorned,&quot; or something to that extent (seemed new) - should warrant such an award. I seriously thought his Strat was going to bust into flames... Purple flames.
