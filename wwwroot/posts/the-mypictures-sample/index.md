<p>Up next in the new set of samples being produced by the Azure Evangelism Team is the MyPictures sample. This sample uses Web API jQuery to post images to a Web API site running in Azure Web Sites, where the images files are stored in Azure Blob Storage
  and their metadata is stored in Azure Table Storage. </p>
<p>If you&#x2019;re tinkering with Web API and wondering how to use it to do uploads, or if you&#x2019;ve been looking into how to use Azure Storage and need a good example of how to implement it, this sample is definitely for you. In 15 minutes, you&#x2019;ll be saving your
  images to the cloud for retrieval later, all using an HTML 5/jQuery interface that performs the upload and retrieval instantaneously. </p>
<p>As with all the other samples we&#x2019;ll produce, the MyPictures sample lives in
  <a href="https://github.com/WindowsAzure-Samples/MyPictures">its very own GitHub.com repository</a>, so if you experience any issues or have suggestions you can give us feedback on the sample using GitHub.com&#x2019;s issue-reporting features. Likewise, the sample is being made available
  <a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/windowsazure/MyPictures-on-Windows-91bb3057">on the Azure samples site</a> . The video below is also
  <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/The-MyPictures-Windows-Azure-Web-Sites-Sample">posted on Channel 9</a>, and will walk you through the whole process of setting up the site and deploying it to Azure Web Sites. Get your
  <a href="http://bit.ly/windowsazuretrial">free Azure account</a>  to get started, then grab the code and deploy it using Web Deploy. </p>
