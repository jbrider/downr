<p>Anyone who knows me knows darned well that I&apos;ll be a coffee fan to the end so it&apos;s not surprising that I&apos;ll start a post like this. Granted, the first thing I do in the morning on the way through through the kitchen is to push the little green button
  on the front of the coffee maker. The second thing I do is to fill this little metal pot we have next to the kitchen sink with warm water. Into this water I place an 8oz. bottle - excuse me, <em>bobbiez</em>  - where it sits, warming for a few moments
  while I execute the greatest part of my morning.&#xA0;</p>
<p>This best part, like my good friend
  <a href="http://scottcate.com/family/courtneys-world-morning-ritual/" title="scott and his ritual">Scott</a>, is when I get to wake up my kid, Gabe. Granted, I&apos;m not the first one out of the bed every single morning, but seeing Scott post and realizing that the morning involves Gabe&apos;s best mood of the day, has inspired me to do my best each morning
  to <em>be the one </em> who gets up first. At 7 AM, Gabe is usually lying in his crib talking. The walls, the posts, the mattress, the animals on the wall, we&apos;re not sure. Either way, he&apos;s lying there talking. When I go into his crib I open the blinds,
  watching him the whole time because it&apos;s quite adorable to see him cover his eyes. Then I say &quot;where is GAY-BREE-UHL?&quot; really loudly, and he reveals his face. We usually play this game for a few moments while I prepare myself for the gift I&apos;ll be removing
  from his diaper (this takes courage some mornings, when I know from the smell that&apos;s found it&apos;s way into the kitchen what awaits. We remove nighty, change diaper, all the while talking and rubbing the animal stickers on the wall next to the changing
  table. He stares up, he waves, he kicks, I gently hold his legs and put them into the legs of his little jeans, sweatpants, or cargo pants. I pull his shirt over his <em>massive </em> grape (head) and we play peek-a-boo again. Then I pick him up and
  bring him into the kitchen, where mom is usually up and rubbing her eyes or pouring the now-brewed coffee into at least one of our mugs. She sits down in the arm chair with him and the room-temperature <em>bobbiez </em> and I at the kitchen bar with
  my laptop (and coffee) and the three of us kick off our day.&#xA0;</p>
<p>Another good friend told me to enjoy this time, to hold him and play with him and to let him giggle and what-not because the times wouldn&apos;t last long. That is <em>so true. </em> Now that I&apos;m at home more, I love the time I get to spend with him in the
  morning. He is in his absolute best mood at 7 AM - and sometimes in his worst mood 12 hours later, which for the first few months of his life was about the only time I would see him. These mornings are awesome and start me off in the best possible mood.
  He is absolutely amazing, the best, most complicated, most rewarding thing I&apos;ve ever done. The best part is that I consistently find myself remembering that he&apos;s something I can bank on for the rest of my life, something I can depend on. It is truly
  a blessing to be a parent (and to have such great friends and family who inspire you to be better)!</p>
