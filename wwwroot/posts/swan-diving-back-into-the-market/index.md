<p>As of this afternoon I am officially on the market. I&apos;d gone in a different direction with my career than I think I maybe should have and - in retrospect - feel this might steer things back on the course I should&apos;ve been on the whole time. My <em>schtick </em> is
  browser-based application development, the middleware that drives that type of application, and whenever possible the act of educating people in the teensy shreds of knowledge I&apos;ve gained over the years in knowing how to do such arts on their own. I
  hadn&apos;t been doing many of those things in my last position.</p>
<p>Despite taking the most gigantic technical leaps of my career in recent years, thanks to some amazing colleagues who reminded me of the never-ending directions one can go in using the .NET Framework, I never felt like I was doing the thing I got into
  this industry to do - <em>connect people using the web</em> . I thank my ex-co-workers for their knowledge-sharing and their instruction in so many areas, and wish them the best. I have nothing but hope for their efforts and organization. Likewise, I
  have nothing but faith that I&apos;ve been put back into the fray for a reason, and that said reason will present itself in short order if I say a few prayers, direct myself, and keep my chin up.&#xA0;</p>
<p>Now I&apos;m off to find the next challenge, and hope that it comes knocking relatively <em>quickly </em> because this is a mildly discomforing first for me...</p>
