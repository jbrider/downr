Today in our office we have declared a new practice. Today will be Third Person Day. All day, each of the members of the game will be required to talk about themselves in third person ONLY. No &quot;I&quot; or &quot;me&quot; will be allowed. Brady believes (caught myself
there) that it will be an interesting experiment. For motivation, the group has decided that each usage of the disallowed pronouns will result in the purchase of 1 beer for the rest. Point is, Brady needs to be careful not to talk about himself today.
At least not in that tense....
