<p>If you&#x2019;ve not yet used
  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/web/webmatrix/">WebMatrix</a>,
  <strike>what are you waiting for?!?!?!?</strike> you&#x2019;re missing out on a great IDE that helps you get a web site up and running in very little time. Whether you&#x2019;re coding your site in PHP, Node.js, or ASP.NET, WebMatrix has you covered with all sorts of great
  features. One of the awesome features of WebMatrix is the number of templates it has baked in. Starter templates for any of the languages it supports are available, as are a number of practical templates for things like stores, personal sites, and so
  on. As of the latest release of Azure Web Sites, all the awesome WebMatrix templates are now also available in the Web Sites application gallery. Below, you&#x2019;ll see a screen shot of the web application gallery, with the <em>Boilerplate</em>  template
  selected. </p>

</p>
<p>Each of the WebMatrix gallery projects is&#xA0; now duplicated for you as a Web Site application gallery entry. So even if you&#x2019;re not yet using WebMatrix, you&#x2019;ll still have the ability to start your site using one of its handy templates. </p>
<p>Impossible, you say? </p>
<p>See below for a screenshot from within the WebMatrix templates dialog, and you&#x2019;re sure to notice the similarities that exist between the Application Gallery entries and those previously only available from directly within WebMatrix. </p>

<p>As before, WebMatrix is fully supported as the easiest Azure-based web development IDE. After you follow through with the creation of a site from the Application Gallery template list from within the Azure portal, you can open the site live directly within
  WebMatrix. From directly within the portal&#x2019;s dashboard of a new Boilerplate site, I can click the WebMatrix icon and the site will be opened up in the IDE. </p>

</p>
<p>Now that it&#x2019;s open, if I make any changes to the site, they&#x2019;ll be uploaded right back into Azure Web Sites, live for consumption by my site&#x2019;s visitors. Below, you&#x2019;ll see the site opened up in WebMatrix. </p>
