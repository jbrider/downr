so i&apos;ve been discussing the notion of this interesting style of music that i&apos;ve been into for the past few years with people who know about it. the most popular artist of this genre would arguably have to be the band
<a href="http://www.trts.com/">tortoise</a>, to whom i&apos;ve been listening since college. for some reason i missed them in concert each time they&apos;ve been near me, but that&apos;s a series of other stories. i&apos;ve called tortoise and other bands of this genre (some of whom are on the
<a href="http://www.cstrecords.com/html/menu.html">constellation</a>  label, which I find to be an excellent resource along with the group
<a href="http://www.mogwai.co.uk/">mogwai</a> ) &quot;minimalist,&quot; &quot;experimental,&quot; and most recently, &quot;lo-fi.&quot; somehow none of these terms really fit the sound, which reminds me to a degree of one of the best bands to date - my bloody valentine. this weekend i heard a new definition of the sound,
which is usually defined by - well - layer upon layer of guitar-focused textures that meld together in a sort of peaceful wall of sound. that new definition is pretty-well defined and explained on this
<a href="http://altmusic.about.com/library/weekly/aa021301.htm">about.com page</a> . if anyone has any other links, bands, or information related to post-rock, please let me know. i&apos;m hooked on it. i find myself humming new stuff all the time that&apos;s reminiscent of this style, and when i have my guitar-in-hand, i end
up playing stuff like it, too. post-rock. yeah, i like the sound of that. it kind of gives me a simple, minimalistic, white-page-with-black-text feeling whenever i hear it.
