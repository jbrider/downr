<p>If you enjoy using NuGet to obtain and distribute your open source work and you maintain a blog or a site using Orchard, this post&apos;s for you. I&apos;ve written a widget that will allow you to enter your author name. Then, the widget will hit the NuGet OData
  API and find any packages published with that author name. From that, the HTML is build up through the Orchard pipeline and what you get is a nice list of NuGet projects. Check it out for yourself on the
  <a href="http://www.bradygaster.com/mynugets">MyNuGets project page</a>  or in the
  <a href="http://orchardproject.net/gallery/List/Modules/Orchard.Module.MyNuGets">Orchard Gallery</a> .&#xA0;</p>
