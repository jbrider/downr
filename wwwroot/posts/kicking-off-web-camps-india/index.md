<p>Next week I&#x2019;ll be speaking at the
  <a href="http://www.devcamps.ms/web">Web Camps</a>  events in India. The web camps series, put together by my trusty teammate
  <a href="https://twitter.com/jongalloway">Jon Galloway</a>, offers web developers a glimpse into all the new web-related stuff the ASP.NET and Visual Studio teams have been cooking. I&#x2019;m looking forward to the trip, as I&#x2019;ve never been further East than Sweden. My team has this habit of coming
  up with nifty out-of-office emails so I decided to make a map, originally thinking I&#x2019;d jam the map into an email. The image ending up being pretty huge so I&#x2019;m sparing the team the extra room in their mailboxes by sharing it here instead. </p>

<p>This should be a pretty neat trip. I&#x2019;m thankful for the opportunities I get like this to talk about and demonstrate the awesome work the engineers do here. They make that part of the job easy. When you love a product as much as I&#x2019;ve loved ASP.NET and
  Visual Studio for this long, the idea of showing folks how to use it and to give them some new tricks is <strong>cake.</strong>  This sort of thing &#x2013; talking about how awesome our products are and about the <em>awesomer</em>  people involved in their
  creation &#x2013; is the best part of my job.&#xA0; </p>
<p>What makes that part of job difficult is the missing-of-family while I&#x2019;m on the road. My wife the most supportive woman you could have the luck to know and I&#x2019;m the luckiest guy in the world for having her there to support me. My sons always miss me, so
  that&#x2019;s the saddest part of every trip, but they know how it works so they&#x2019;re usually pretty forgiving, as the code below demonstrates. Coming home to this familiar program is without a doubt the <strong>icing on the cake. </strong> </p>

<p>So tomorrow I&#x2019;ll start my first trip to the other side of the globe. Wish me luck, and if you&#x2019;re in the area, come on out to learn some great stuff about ASP.NET, Azure and Visual Studio!</p>
