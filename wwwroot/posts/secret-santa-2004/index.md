i remember these cheesy girls from my high school. every high school had a group of girls like this - they drove vw cabriolet convertibles, had long blonde hair all cut the same way, every friday dressed up in cheerleader costumes, and bubbled everywhere
they went. they called themselves the &quot;secret santas&quot; because each year they&apos;d surprised one another with cutesy little presents at lunch time just before the christmas break. as it turns out there were a lot of other secret santas out there in the world.
so much so that the concept has spread to the internet.
