I know exactly what I would wish for. I would wish for Rick Rubin to work with me, to educate me on how things work in the music industry, and to help me better understand my capabilities as a musician myself. Not really because I am totally in love with
Slayer, or the Peppers, or Danzig. I mean, I do like all those cats. Not even because of the fact that I consider the Cult&apos;s Electric to be the single most influential album of my childhood. I just feel this thing for Rick Rubin, like he and I kind of
share a few opinions about music, how it is supposed to sound, and what it is supposed to do for people. Quotes like this one from an
<a href="http://www.digitalprosound.com/Features/Interviews-Discuss/RickRubin3.htm">interview</a>  I found online make it abundantly clear that Rick Rubin and I share a few opinions and outlooks about how music is and can be created.

I&apos;ve tried for months to describe how it feels to be in front of my instruments and my computer, with a concept in my head. A whole opus raging between my ears, while my fingers work frantically to reproduce the imaginary sounds before they&apos;re gone. This
quote sums it up perfectly for me, and makes me want even more than I did before (which I considered damn near impossible) to have coffee, a jam session, a walk on the beach, or a five-minute chat with Rubin. I know I&apos;d learn from it. Maybe he&apos;d even
make a cool new friend!!??!
