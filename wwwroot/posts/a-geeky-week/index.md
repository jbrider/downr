man, i&apos;m just sucked into my work again. but this time, i&apos;m really enjoying it from a lot of different angles. my current situation allows quite a bit of focus on the ideas and notions behind reusability; remember, my organization is rich in a process
dedicated to &quot;doing your job so well you automate your own existence.&quot; from a darwinian perspective i guess that&apos;s not such a great attitude to adopt in such a competitive environment. of course, that&apos;s when you have bad managers. good managers see these
reuses as &quot;holy smokes, we just too how many hours out of everyone&apos;s process?&quot; and redeem your provisions to the group. it&apos;s nice, but then again, can be a little confusing to some. think of it this way - you know you&apos;re a geek when you come up with a
provider-model-based architecture to process text files in a linear format. yeah, it ain&apos;t art or anything, and by no means is the notion of screen scraping anywhere near remotely entertaning. that is, unless you decide to make it entertaining. to make
it challenging. i like to take that attitude of &quot;if i have to do it today i&apos;ll probably have to - or someone else&apos;ll have to - do something pretty similar to it.&quot; thus, why not create a &quot;driving or genetic mechanism&quot; that observers (to quote our GOF-loving
counterparts) can just hook into? yeah, that sounds like more fun than 28 functions.
