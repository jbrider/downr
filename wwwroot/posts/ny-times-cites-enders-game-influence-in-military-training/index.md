<a href="http://www.ids.appstate.edu/watauga.html">watuaga college</a>  that took one of those neo-70&apos;s hip-ducation angles, with social commentary and philo-socio-techno-analysis as focii of the faculty and reading material. <em>these people had <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0553348477/qid=1105130178/sr=8-2/ref=pd_csp_2/102-3450782-5328112?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">ecotopia</a>  as required summer reading, if that gives you any better picture of the type of scene. not that that&apos;s a bad thing, mind you, it&apos;s just really frickin liberal and forward-thinking. almost bold. balls.., yeah... education with balls).</em> anyway, orson taught - and still teaches, i think -
