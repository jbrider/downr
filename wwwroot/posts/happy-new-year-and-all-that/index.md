well, i&apos;ve been a little quiet, as my favorite aunt (who just had a birthday!) likes to remind me. sorry about that, i&apos;ve just been busy. everything&apos;s going well, i&apos;m not moving, or quitting, or sick, or anything like that. nothing of the sort. i&apos;ve been
pretty busy. what&apos;s nice about the business is that i&apos;ve been focusing on my job. not my &quot;own work&quot; or anything, but on my job. if i&apos;m coding, it&apos;s been at work during working hours and not on the couch at home. when i&apos;m at home i&apos;m playing with roxanne
and her new friend bob (the bass i picked up to augment my recordings). sorry if i&apos;ve been slack, i&apos;ve just had too many things going on to write down my thoughts on all the things that are going on. i&apos;ll see what i can do about picking up the pace a
little.
