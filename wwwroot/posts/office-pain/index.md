[What follows is what I (and a few other peeps in my area) would love to say to the
<strike>lady</strike> beast two or three cubes away] Lady, I know you have to be on the phone all day. I know it is a priority that you speak with your customers and business partners on a regular basis. And I know that you are somewhat large in stature, and
resultingly have a voice that carries. I mean, look at me, I&apos;m over six feet tall and have the build of an out-of-shape linebacker. I know how it is. But lady, its like this. I can hear every word of your conversation. The girl on the opposite side of
me than you can hear every word of your conversation, as can her teammembers who work on the other side of her cube. If you hadn&apos;t been counting, that&apos;s over 4 aisles away. We can hear you clearly, as though we were in the meeting with you. It wouldn&apos;t
be so bad if you were on the phone for 20 minutes a day. Heck, it wouldn&apos;t be so bad if you were on the phone for an hour a day, at said volume. The thing is, you are on the phone all day long. At the same volume. It is absolutely shocking to me that
you have the amount of breath requisite for such long-winded chats; I know that my own moments of loud long-windedness rarely fail to exceed the 10-minute mark. So I ask you, on behalf of everyone within earshot (which is most likely everyone on this
floor), respect your peers and lower your volume. I&apos;m sure that your volume is not only aggravating, but most likely fails to comply with our corporate privacy policy [since she is
<strike>talking to</strike> yelling at external customers]. If that&apos;s the case, you are not only violating our earspace, but most likely the law, as well. So how about you lower your volume. Or get a door. Or just move to the basement. Whatever it takes, just
make sure you don&apos;t bug the rest of us all day, every day, any more. Thanks.
