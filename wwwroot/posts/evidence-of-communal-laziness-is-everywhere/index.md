g and i were having this talk the other day. we were discussing how, when we were kids, it infuriated us to hear our parents say things like &quot;when i was your age people didn&apos;t do that,&quot; or &quot;when i was your age i didn&apos;t have toys like that,&quot; and the ever-popular
&quot;when i was your age things weren&apos;t so easy, your generation is lazy.&quot; the topic of our talk was in the reality that we&apos;re now hearing such things emit from ourselves, because we keep seeing evidence everywhere that people expect too much today. sure,
i love technology. it pays the bills. not only that, it makes paying the bills easier. for one thing, technology is a lot of fun - i&apos;m a geek for pete&apos;s sake, of course i love chips, electricity, simplicity, and above all, gadgetry. like everything else
in the world, though, technology and the dependency we all have upon it must be kept on a short leash. we have got to stop taking things for granted, and we&apos;ve got to curb the pattern of behavior resident and obvious everywhere these days. need an example
of the point i&apos;m making?
<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/TECH/10/27/biotechnology.cats/index.html">here you go</a> . you want a cat, you gotta accept some responsibility. those engineers plan on coming up with a cat that doesn&apos;t need food or water so you don&apos;t have to trouble yourself with taking care of the little thing? likewise, you gotta take the
good with the bad. i love g, and she has two cats. so for the first 6 months of our incredibly happy relationship i had to spend each and every day waking up with a runny nose. i had to deal with allergies, and i had to start taking medication (again)
each day to deal with it. things got easier, i got over the whole debacle and the allergic reactions rapidly dissipated, and now i&apos;ve got two new wonderful, furry little feline friends. it sucked at first, but it was well worth it - i&apos;ve grown to love
the pets, and each day is happier as a result of having them around. i can&apos;t explain how happy it&apos;s made me to have such adorable little friends. it&apos;s awesome! but i didn&apos;t whine about it. i didn&apos;t expect the allergies to become easier over time to deal
with (even though my body did aclimate and the allergies went away with time and exposure). i just knew it was something i had to live with if i planned to live with her. i take the good with the bad. i adapt, i overcome, and in the end i have a much
better life as a result of having tried harded to &quot;deal with it.&quot; and that&apos;s the point. people, you have to take the good with the bad. my kids will not grow up expecting everything be handed to them on silver freaking platters. the kids in school today
(so i hear) are whiney little snots because mommy and daddy have taught them well, taught them that life owes them something. i&apos;ve heard stories of overcrowded schools that have to use mobile homes for added space whose offices began to receive phone
calls from pissy parents who say to them &quot;i live in such-and-such [well-to-do-average-home-cost-around-a-mil] neighborhood, and i&apos;ve heard that my son goes to class in a trailer. isn&apos;t there something we can do about that?&quot; likewise, the parents who call
in to complain about the grades their spoiled little brat kids <strong>earned</strong>  - &quot;oh isn&apos;t there something that can be done? duke university doesn&apos;t accept students who make &apos;b&apos; grades, there&apos;s got to be something that can be done.&quot;
<blockquote>
  my bet - when asked on the ballot about &quot;new taxes&quot; that will be used to make the school systems better these very same people laugh and check the &quot;deny&quot; box. the same people who bitch about overcrowding refuse to pay more taxes to spend money on schools
  so that they don&apos;t have the overcrowding problem in the first place.
