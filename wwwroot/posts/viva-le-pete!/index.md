<a href="http://peterwright.blogspot.com/2006/09/passionate-programmers-manifesto.html" title="Strange new worlds, and programming languages...: The passionate programmer&apos;s manifesto">Pete Wright</a>  caught my attention a few years ago when he
<a href="http://peterwright.blogspot.com/2006/09/good-bye-microsoft-pete-has-now-left.html">took the words right out of my mouth</a>  and today he comes back with the perfect manifesto. Good going, Pete. Between this guy and my new co-worker, I&apos;ve decided to start learning Ruby. Yes, Ruby. To quote my co-worker, &quot;MS stuff is what I do at work,
but I gotta have something to do for fun. That&apos;s why I like PHP and Apache.&quot; I can&apos;t stand Apache, but I&apos;m getting into Ruby these days. Expect more on that too. Expect .Net stuff not to go away, because that&apos;s what we do at work and I&apos;m still cool with
it and what-not. But, like my co-worker and Pete, I recognize the overwhelming, stinky, ever-rising pile of dung that is the MS way, and how it feeds into the greedy money-lined pockets of the very people with whom I&apos;ve chosen to spar for the past 2 decades.
I&apos;m not into marketing, I&apos;m not into the rich, and for goodness sake, I am into the passionate aspects of the career path I&apos;ve chosen. So, I might as well have a little fun in the process, eh?
