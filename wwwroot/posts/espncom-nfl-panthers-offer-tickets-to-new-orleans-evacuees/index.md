Truly an excellent display of southern hospitality by our home team. Short version if you can&apos;t read the article yourself -
<a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2155587&amp;CMP=OTC-DT9705204233">the Panthers are giving away 350 tickets</a>  to the Katrina survivors who&apos;ve been evacuated to our area, where they&apos;ve been for the past few days.
