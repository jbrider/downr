<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/12/06/step-1-i-purchased-a-23andme-dna-test/" title="TechCrunch on 23andme&apos;s test">TechCrunch&apos;s Michael Arrington has decided to take the plunge with self-perpetuated DNA testing</a> . He raises some very interesting points about
<a href="https://www.23andme.com/" title="23andme - genetics for the rest of us">the process the company 23andme has initiated</a> . If you haven&apos;t heard about it, here&apos;s the skinny - you can order your own DNA testing to be done for less than a grand. With this information you can learn basically anything you would ever want to know
about yourself, your body, and your future (genetically speaking). As Michael points out, some of these items might not be the most comforting, but if you&apos;re game the knowledge can be all yours. I&apos;ll be following his story closely. I&apos;m anxious to hear
what he learns.
