<p>You may have noticed I&#x2019;ve been getting into Azure recently. You could say my head&#x2019;s going to be even more in the cloud than usual, because I&#x2019;ve accepted a position with Microsoft as an Azure Technical Evangelist. </p>
<p>Admittedly, I was relatively late to the Azure party. I&#x2019;ve been seeing so many colleagues do amazing things with it -
  <a href="http://www.structuretoobig.com/">Brian Hitney</a>  with
  <a href="http://www.rockpaperazure.com/">Rock, Paper, Azure</a>,
  <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/mlinnen">Mike Linnen</a>  with his
  <a href="http://www.protosystem.net/post/2011/08/21/Lawn-Sprinkler-the-Demo-Part-2.aspx">Netduino/Service Bus/WP7 solution</a>, and
  <a href="http://blogs.captechconsulting.com/blog/author/Mike%20Diiorio">Mike Diiorio&#x2019;s</a>  presentation at the
  <a href="http://richmondcodecamp.org/">Richmond Code Camp</a> . Once I dove in, I couldn&#x2019;t look back, and now, I&#x2019;ll be finding just how far the cloud goes. </p>

  </a> My team is amazing and I&#x2019;m honored to be a part of it. I&#x2019;ll be working with/for
  <a href="http://www.wadewegner.com/">Wade Wegner</a>,
  <a href="http://ntotten.com/">Nathan Totten</a>,
  <a href="http://jamesconard.com/">James Conard</a>,
  <a href="http://drewby.com/">Drew Robbins</a>, and a lot of other bright, talented folks in Building 24. I&#x2019;m not sure what specific Azure areas I&#x2019;ll focus on out of the gate, but API&#x2019;s and SOA&#x2019;s are areas of interest to me and I hope to focus in those areas. Right now, I&#x2019;m just
  thankful to have the opportunity and look forward to getting started. </p>
<p>The next few months will be interesting, to say the least. The position is based out of Redmond, so after years of wanting to near Seattle (my favorite city so far), my family will finally have the opportunity. We&#x2019;ve started investigating our options
  and preparing ourselves, and we have been overwhelmed at how hospitable and helpful Microsoft is being to help in the transition.</p>
