<p>Things are going well. I&apos;m finding a good deal of leads and getting back into the technology I&apos;ve for so long enjoyed only to have been forced to abandon for the last year in my daily work life.</p>
<p>I&apos;ve gotten back into the web browser and I have to say I&apos;m enjoying it, as much as I&apos;m enjoying learning about
  <a href="http://www.hibernate.org/343.html" title="NHibernate">NHibernate</a>,
  <a href="http://ninject.org/" title="Ninject">Ninject</a>, and a host of other topics I&apos;ve somewhat disregarded as a result of being pretty sure they wouldn&apos;t be of much use to my previous job anyway. I actually discovered Ninject some time back when it was still under initial development and didn&apos;t
  give it the time it deserved so I&apos;m excited to get into it now to learn.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I&apos;m happy I&apos;m no longer working in an environment where my own professional goals aren&apos;t totally in accordance with those of my employer and I feel pretty certain I&apos;m going to have an exciting few weeks getting re-acquainted with the technologies
  I&apos;ve been bookmarking and finding interesting, only to lack the ability to put to use in my work life.</p>
<p>Through this rough first week of unemployment, my wife has been amazingly supportive. This is nothing new, she&apos;s always been a rock in my life and in the lives of so many other friends and neighbors. I am really lucky to have such a wonderful wife and
  child, and though we&apos;re entering a relatively scary time together I know we&apos;re entering it <em>together, </em> and that&apos;s all that really matters in the end. I&apos;m pretty sure I tell her often enough to make sure she knows how confident I am that I&apos;d fall
  on my face without her, but it never hurts to put it out there to make sure she&apos;s reminded as often as possible.&#xA0;</p>
<p>Bottom line is that I&apos;m happy in spite of the stress of looking for a job. I have an amazing network of peers, colleagues, and good people on my side. Each call I make to my network instills in me the faith that I&apos;ve built a good one, and that they&apos;re
  going to do everything to repay the help I&apos;ve tried to give them for the past few years. I&apos;ve always known that looking out for recruiters and colleagues would pay off in professional karma in good time, and right now I&apos;m seeing evidence all over that
  I was accurate in my faithful estimates.</p>
<p>My departure was a blessing, and I look forward to the next steps I&apos;ll take in my career.&#xA0;</p>
